# There are 5 features:
#   dejadup
#   local
#   duplicity
#   remote
#   manual
#
# dejadup only needs to know, when it is run. Hence, it is given a `rank`
#
# The rest of the features hold lists of entries.
#   Each entry has a `rank` for execution order.
#
#   local:
#       Copies folders or files from `from` to `to` via rsync.
#       It is optional to specify rsync options via `options`.
#       The default `options` (if not otherwise specified) is `-avrtlzzp`
#   remote:
#       Copies folders or files via rsync using ssh.
#       Connects to `address` with `user` and copies all folders given as a
#       list in `folders` to the local directory `internal`.
#       The ssh passphrase is given via STDIN at runtime.
#   duplicity:
#       Archives data at `from` to `to`.
#       Duplicity can be fully modified using the `options` list.
#       The `from` entry is optional and required depending on the
#       configuration passed as `options`.
#   manual:
#       manual allows full control by passing a command as argument list `cmd`.
